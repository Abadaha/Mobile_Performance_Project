"Quality Assurance (QA) is one of the most critical pillars in modern software development, and its role goes far beyond simply testing applications or finding bugs. QA is a comprehensive discipline that ensures every stage of development, frm requirement analysis to the delivery of the final product, is carried out according to high-quality standards. Having a QA team in any software company is not a luxury; it is a necessity to maintain customer satisfaction and build trust in the market."
